# Traffic Sign Detection System
We are building a Traffic Sign Detection System using computer vision + machine learning

## Abstract:

A comparative study of U-Net and Mask R-CNN architectures for traffic sign detection. This repository hosts a full machine learning pipeline—from data preprocessing to evaluation—benchmarked on the Kaggle Car Detection dataset using IoU, F1-Score, and standard segmentation metrics.


**Objectives:**
* Create system that takes images of streets with vehicles and detects traffic signs in them
* Build full Machine learning pipeline (data prep, model training, evaluation, and analysis)
* Compare two different image segmentation models (U-Net vs Mask R-CNN)

**Contributors:** 

1. Ferdinand Virtudes
- Developed Project Roadmap and delegated tasks
- Researched kaggle dataset
- Implemented MASK R-CNN model
- Implemented U-NET model
- U-NET/Mask R-CNN preprocessing from Kaggle dataset
- Conducted experiments (K-fold, hyperparameter tuning, final test evaluation) 
- Created base presentation template
- Prepared presentation 

## How It's Made:

**Data used:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pkdarabi/cardetection/data

**Tech used:** Python, Google Colab, 

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

## Lessons Learned:
* M1 Mac limitations for running Mask R-CNN: had to reduce batch size and learning rate to accomodate
