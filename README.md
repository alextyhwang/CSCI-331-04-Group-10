# Traffic Sign Detection System
We are building a Traffic Sign Detection System using computer vision + machine learning

**Abstract**
A comparative study of U-Net and Mask R-CNN architectures for traffic sign detection. This repository hosts a full machine learning pipeline—from data preprocessing to evaluation—benchmarked on the Kaggle Car Detection dataset using IoU, F1-Score, and standard segmentation metrics.


**Objectives:**
* Create system that takes images of streets with vehicles and detects traffic signs in them
* Build full Machine learning pipeline (data prep, model training, evaluation, and analysis)
* Compare two different image segmentation models (U-Net vs Mask R-CNN)
